# Rutgers - Earthquake Mapping

## Purpose

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this project is to create an interactive website to map out specific key points. The purpose of this project is to use my knowledge of JavaScript, and geoJSON data using the d3.json and leaflet.js libraries to display multi-layered geographical map to display earthquakes details. 

## Results

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is user friendly. By viewing the photos below, you can view three different layouts (Street view, Satellite view, and Dark mode). You can also filter to view specifics key zone such as Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes. You cannot view this without a specific API Key.
